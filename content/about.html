    <div class="about-me">
        <p>I call Copenhagen, Denmark, my home.
        As a fullstack webdeveloper I built websites and apps for a living.</p>
        <p>I care about building software that has a positive impact on the end user.</p>
        <p>TDD, code reviews and continous practice are therefore stable parts of my toolset</p>
        <p>I'm also part of this really deranged... I mean, absolutely lovely and extremely competent consultancy called <a href="https://deranged.dk">deranged</a></p>
        <p>My leisure time is spread across a multitude of hobbies and activities, ranging between being a scoutleader and working out.</p>
